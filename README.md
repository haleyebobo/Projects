# Projects
Projects completed during Masters program.

Welcome to my GitHub! I am placing all of my big project codes from my Applied Statistics program here, feel free to take a look around. I'll be updating as I complete more projects. 

The file titled "Employee Retention" is an R notebook that I created to analyze a human resource dataset to predict employee turnover.
The file titled "Global Terrorism Database Analysis" is a SAS code developed using SAS Enterprise Miner in order to analyze the Global Terrorism Database to predict successful IED related terrorist attacks.
